No support attached. Good luck have fun.



In the i3 directory are like 500 similar scripts.
They are for my different machines/monitor configs.
If you use multimonitor setups / detachable screen setups, modify the i3/toggletv.sh script. Don't ask me how, it's easy gl.


AND REPLACE IN ALL CONFIG FILES MY USERNAME WITH YOURS. WHEREVER YOU SEE "v4ngbz" (´ω｀)


NEEDED DEPENDACIES FOR:

ZSH SHELL (.zshrc):

POLYBAR MODULES (modules.ini):

https://github.com/haideralipunjabi/polybar-browsermediacontrol

https://github.com/Jvanrhijn/polybar-spotify


Make sure you have fixed the paths in the respective config / module files. Don't be cringe.
